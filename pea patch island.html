	<p> It is <b>DEFINETLY</b> worth it to take a trip for a
	great and spooky experience to this scary haunted Island!! You
	wouldn't regret it, and.....
	<p> I HAVE PROOF:
		<ul>
			<li><blockquote><i>"Almost every summer as a young child I would visit Fort Delaware 
			with my history obsessed father. When I was younger I was merely concerned 
			with the neat rocks and canons to climb on and the historical facts my father 
			made sure I knew. Built on Pea Patch Island, the fort served as a major prison 
			for Confederate prisoners during the Civil War. As I grew up I became interested 
			in a different history of the Fort, the paranormal. I know it sounds weird, but 
			even if you do not believe in ghosts the stories are still very interesting and 
			make for a great ghost tour through the dungeons, kitchen and captains 
			dormitories."</i></blockquote></li>
			<li><blockquote><i>"Fort Delaware is honest about all of its history including the presence of 
			ghosts, poltergeists and unruly spirits that walk the prison halls and tunnels. 
			I had the chance to witness and participate in a full investigation! I could seek out 
			spirits in the haunted prisoner barracks, mess hall, officer's kitchen, ordnance
			room area, officers quarters, prisoner barracks, and west end of Endicott 
			section of fort. I even got to bring my own ghost hunting equipment, as
		   	well. It was a very cool experience if you ask me!"</i></blockquote></li>
		</ul>

	<p>THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU HANDLE A LITTLE SPOOKINESS AND TAKE A TOUR FOR THE PEA PATCH ISLAND?!
